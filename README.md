<h2>Description</h2>
<p>hungArray is a mock-restaurant application created by myself, along with 3 of my classmates. The purpose is to provide basic functionality for any restaurant to plug their information into and use.</p>

<p>The application has multiple pages including pages for a menu, reservations, and a password protected take-out page.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>The design for this site was made using the Materialize CSS framework, with the homepage using a parallax style. The log in function is created using the PassportJs npm in combination with the bcrypt npm to hash the users created password. All user data is stored in a MySQL database. This project was a great learning experience for dealing with merge conflicts and collaborating with teammates with different schedules.</p>
